- 👋 Hi, I’m @georgie-the-developer (George)
- 👀 I’m interested in calisthenics and coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on React projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: my Telegram: https://t.me/georgie-the-developer. My linkedIn account is linked in the profile info.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: no fun facts... yet.
- Additional skill: I am mastering touch typing, when I'm done I will attach a speed & accuracy sertificate here.
- Note: some older repositories can have 2 github pages links, because my account was previously named demina-ivan23. I've decided to name it after my name, though, and now it's named georgie-the-developer.
